# Java Streams Practical Session

This repository contains demo and practical exercises on Java Streams.

Some of them were used to prepare and support the [KLx talks #1](https://www.meetup.com/klx-talks/events/311551910/?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=share-btn_savedevents_share_modal&utm_source=link&utm_version=v2).

## Code presented at KLx Talks #1

### Exercises (Kahoot not included)

[StreamExercisesTest](src/test/java/klx/StreamExercisesTest.java)

### Benchmark before after parallel stream

[ParallelStreamTest](src/test/java/klx/ParallelStreamTest.java)

## What you can do with this repo

There are some exercises here that were built during preparations but not used during the presentation. 

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in your IDE 
3. Review the exercises used during the talk and try to replace traditional loops by stream without looking at the solutions.
4. Run the tests to see what needs to be implemented
5. Implement the missing code in the classes
